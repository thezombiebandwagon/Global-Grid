# Global-Grid
This is a project that I am creating in order to make an application that can be used by players of the game system Shadowrun. 
The intent is to create an application that will allow players to connect to each other via the internet and create an interface to easily assist game play.
The following are features that I am looking to create
  - A chat module
  - A dice roller module
  - An initiative module
  - Character sheet compatibility with Chummer5, a popular open source solution for creating character sheets
  - A shared viewer module. The idea here is to provide a view for players in order to collaborate on plans, view combat maps in order to facilitate easier combat
  - An adventure module importer. Allow GMs to create, import, and edit new modules as required!
  - A server module: This will allow users to create a server in order to allow other users to connect to the game. 
  - A GM module. This is designed to be used by a GM in order to make required changes to other modules.
    - Within the GM module I expect to have the following modules:
    - Story-Telling Module: A module designed to hold notes for the GM
    - Environment Module: This is a module designed to easily apply the environment variables within the game, so that they can easily be incorporated into rolls
    - Scene Module: Basically the controller for the viewer module. Used to show images, change maps, turn grids on or off
    
    
    I will edit this readme as I have new ideas for features, features become complete, or I find other information becomes relevant.
